However, it wasn’t discovered until 1994 when Lennon’s widow, Yoko Ono, found and shared the recordings with the remaining Beatles: Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. The song faced technical obstacles, so it stayed shelved until recent years.",

The team struggled to isolate Lennon’s vocals from his piano accompaniment. They couldn’t achieve the clear mix they needed back then, so they set the track aside. This might have been the end of the story, but technology would eventually bring 'Now and Then' back to life.",

The breakthrough came from an audio isolation technique used in the recent documentary series, 'The Beatles: Get Back,' directed by Peter Jackson. They used a tool called MAL audio technology to separate vocals and instruments from the original recordings. This tech allowed them to isolate Lennon’s voice from the piano, bringing a clarity they had never achieved before.",

And we all play on it; it’s a genuine Beatles recording. In 2023, to still be working on Beatles music and about to release a new song the public haven’t heard, I think it’s an exciting thing.'",

McCartney contributed on bass, guitar, and piano, adding a slide guitar solo as a tribute to Harrison. Both McCartney and Starr also layered their vocals into the mix, creating a harmony that brings all four Beatles back together one last time.",
