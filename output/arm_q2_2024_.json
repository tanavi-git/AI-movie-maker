This quarter, Microsoft and Google launched their first Arm-based chips for data centers—Microsoft's Azure Cobalt 100 and Google’s Axion. Both of these chips prioritize energy efficiency, which is a critical need as data centers become some of the largest energy consumers globally.",

CSS simplifies complex chip development processes by offering pre-integrated solutions that cut down on both cost and time-to-market. And with AI development timelines getting tighter, demand for these CSS products is rising. Arm doubled their CSS licenses this fiscal year, with clients ranging from smartphone chip designers to data center providers.",

Five times faster processing for the initial token and a threefold improvement in generation speed for new tokens. This kind of efficiency opens up possibilities for more on-device AI processing, which is faster, better for user privacy, and less energy-intensive than relying on the cloud.",
