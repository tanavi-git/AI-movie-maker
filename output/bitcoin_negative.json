      "text": "First, let's talk about the positives. One of the biggest advantages of Bitcoin is decentralization. Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks or governments, Bitcoin operates independently on a peer-to-peer network. This means users have more control over their finances and are less vulnerable to monetary policies that can devalue traditional currencies.",
