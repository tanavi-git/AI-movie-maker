We're going to explore the idea of a world that has changed forever due to the advent of artificial general intelligence—AGI—and how humanity deals with that change. The source of our journey today comes from an article titled '奇妙なリアリズム/人類史の誤配', written by bioshok, which raises some profound questions about the direction our society is headed.",

It's not just a new smartphone or a clever piece of software; it's a complete shift in the way our world functions. We're no longer the smartest beings on the planet, and that realization carries an enormous weight. This is the moment that bioshok writes about—where our species has to come to grips with being overtaken by something we created.",

The backdrop remains familiar, but underneath, a monumental shift has taken place. The author describes this feeling as '奇妙なリアリズム'—a strange realism, almost a surreal blending of the old and the radically new. It’s this juxtaposition that makes the world feel both nostalgic and unrecognizable at the same time.",

They all changed our lives, but nothing quite compares to the birth of a true AGI. This isn't just about a new gadget; it's about humanity's role in the grand scheme of things being fundamentally altered. The changes are cultural, technological, and perhaps most profoundly, existential. We’re talking about a paradigm shift on the scale of our species, and bioshok captures this transition in a very human way.",

Old cityscapes, retro video game aesthetics, even mundane human gossip—they all coexist alongside these extraordinary developments. It’s as if our past clings to us, even as our future is pulled rapidly forward. There’s a nostalgia there, a bittersweet feeling that while everything is changing, some parts of our lives are frozen in time.",

      "text": "Yet, alongside this sense of nostalgia, there is fear. The fear that we are heading towards extinction, or at least a complete transformation of what it means to be human. Bioshok talks about the sudden surge in economic growth brought on by AGI, how it far exceeded what economists had ever predicted. The world economy jumped from slow, predictable growth to an almost unimaginable rate of expansion. But with this growth comes turmoil—unemployment skyrocketing, social unrest, conflicts escalating—all driven by a world that is changing too fast for people to adapt.",

Will we adapt and integrate with these new technologies, or will we be left behind? There’s this strange duality of hope and despair—can we achieve incredible heights on the Kardashev scale, or are we simply headed towards an inevitable end? Bioshok captures this perfectly—the strange feeling of existing on the precipice of something great and terrifying.",

The surroundings are so familiar, so unchanged, and yet there’s this deep, unsettling feeling—almost as if the world as we know it is just a facade, hiding the profound transformations beneath.",

The fear is palpable—what if these superintelligent beings we’ve created don’t share our values? What if we lose control? Bioshok paints a picture of a world that is prosperous, but uneasy—people enjoying the benefits of rapid advancement, yet always aware of the looming risk of extinction.",
