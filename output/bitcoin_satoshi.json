This time, Hoback lays out a compelling narrative pointing to Peter Todd as the genius behind Bitcoin. He even draws a connection to a December 2010 forum thread where, he claims, Todd seemed to be finishing Satoshi’s sentences—literally, as if he had forgotten to switch user accounts.",

In fact, Todd believes that this entire revelation is more of a marketing tactic than a legitimate investigation.

Imagine being accused of controlling billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin—a sum that makes you a prime target for threats, extortion, or worse. He’s been flooded with emails from people asking for money, and he’s concerned about what the exposure of being called Satoshi could mean for him in terms of personal security.",

The idea was to prove he was otherwise occupied—doing anything but developing a groundbreaking digital currency. WIRED hasn’t fully verified the images, but it shows Todd’s determination to fight this allegation with whatever he has.",

Hoback, the filmmaker, thinks it’s a matter of public interest, stating that if this individual potentially controls one-twentieth of the total Bitcoin supply, then people have a right to know who they are. It’s a sentiment that resonates with many who feel transparency in such matters is crucial.",

After all, Bitcoin’s original ethos was about decentralization and creating a system that didn’t require trust in any single person. By exposing Satoshi, we risk undermining that very principle, and we put lives at risk—whether it’s Satoshi or their families, or even people who are wrongly accused, like Todd.",

Bitcoin, as we know it, has grown beyond any one individual, driven by a community of developers, enthusiasts, and investors. Does knowing Satoshi change what Bitcoin has become, or is this all part of a sensational story that gives us, as humans, the closure we often seek when faced with mysteries?",
