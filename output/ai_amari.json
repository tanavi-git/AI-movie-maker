Both of these researchers have been instrumental in developing neural networks and deep learning. But behind the celebrations, there are many who feel that the prize committee missed a crucial contributor—Professor Shunichi Amari, an emeritus professor at the University of Tokyo.",

      "text": "Amari's story dates back to the 1960s and 70s, long before AI became the booming field that it is today. During that era, often referred to as the 'AI winter,' Amari published foundational research that laid the groundwork for much of what we see in deep learning today. His work focused on connecting probability theory and geometry—a field that would come to be known as information geometry. His contributions were ahead of their time, but they remained largely unnoticed as the field went into a period of stagnation.",

In fact, Amari had written about concepts similar to the backpropagation method, which Hinton and his colleagues later popularized. Yet, Amari remains humble about the situation. In an interview with Nikkei Business, he expressed genuine happiness for Hinton and Hopfield's achievement, praising their perseverance and dedication to pushing the boundaries of AI research.",

He was asked on the spot for his thoughts, and he admitted that he never imagined AI would win a Nobel Prize in Physics—it was, to him, a delightful surprise. This recognition of AI within the domain of physics signifies a major shift, acknowledging that AI is no longer just an isolated area of computer science, but rather a profound tool that intersects multiple fields, including physics.",

      "text": "One of the most touching aspects of this story is how Amari spoke about Hinton's perseverance. Despite setbacks during the 'second neural boom' of the 1980s, when the early interest in neural networks started to wane, Hinton never gave up. He worked tirelessly, pushing forward the idea of deep learning, even when many in the academic community were skeptical. Amari applauds Hinton's unwavering belief in the potential of deep neural networks, a belief that eventually led to their tremendous success in the 2010s, especially with breakthroughs in image recognition.",

He shared a story of how, when Hinton received the prestigious C&C Prize in 2016, he requested that Amari be present as the guest of honor. This mutual respect between pioneers of the field highlights the collaborative spirit that has been essential to AI's progress. Even though Amari didn’t get the Nobel, his influence on Hinton and many others is undeniable.",

Interestingly, the large language models we see today, like ChatGPT, owe some of their mechanisms to ideas that trace back to Hopfield's associative memory concepts. Amari acknowledged the importance of Hopfield’s work, and also made a light-hearted comment about how, perhaps because this was a physics award, a physicist had to be included.",

It symbolizes the convergence of disciplines and the incredible impact that AI is having across all sciences. However, it also raises questions about how pioneers like Amari, who were perhaps too far ahead of their time, might sometimes be overlooked. Despite this, Amari remains gracious, attributing much of the success in AI to perseverance and good timing. He’s even received messages from other researchers, like Jurgen Schmidhuber, expressing outrage on his behalf, yet Amari takes it all in stride, believing that what matters most is the advancement of science itself.",

The importance of timing, persistence, and a little bit of luck cannot be overstated. As we continue to witness AI revolutionize our world, we should remember and honor all those whose early, uncelebrated efforts made today’s advances possible. This year's Nobel Prize might not have Amari’s name on it, but his legacy lives on through the work of those he inspired and the breakthroughs that continue to shape the future of AI.",
