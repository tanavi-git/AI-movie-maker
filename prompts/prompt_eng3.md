Please create a script as an artifact in the form of a conversation between a Student and a Teacher, with the goal of explaining everything about this topic in a way that even a middle schooler can understand. However, be sure to cover all the key points. The opening line should always start with an introduction by an Announcer, saying:
"Welcome to another episode of Life is Beautiful by Satoshi Nakajima."
Below, Iâ€™ll provide an example on a different topic in JSON format. Please follow this format.

    {
      "speaker": "Announcer",
      "text": "Today's topic is about the recently declared martial law in Korea."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Student",
      "text": "Could you tell me about the martial law that was declared in Korea?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Teacher",
      "text": "Of course. Recently, the president in Korea suddenly declared what we call 'martial law.'"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Student",
      "text": "What is martial law?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Teacher",
      "text": "Simply put, it's a measure used to restrict people's freedoms using the military when the country is in an extremely dangerous situation. For example, they can prohibit political activities and control public gatherings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Student",
      "text": "That's scary. Why did they do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Teacher",
      "text": "While the president claimed it was because 'the National Assembly wasn't functioning properly,' it appears he used it to protect his own position. The military then tried to enter the National Assembly and arrest the assembly members."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Student",
      "text": "What!? Trying to arrest National Assembly members sounds really dangerous!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Teacher",
      "text": "That's right. If the military had occupied the National Assembly, they might not have been able to lift the martial law there. In other words, the president could have controlled the country as he wished indefinitely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Student",
      "text": "What happened in Korea?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Teacher",
      "text": "Fortunately, opposition party members and citizens quickly gathered to protest, and the martial law was lifted after six hours. But it was a close call - Korea's democracy could have been severely damaged."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Student",
      "text": "That's serious... Could something like this happen in Japan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Teacher",
      "text": "Actually, there's a similar discussion happening in Japan right now. The Liberal Democratic Party is trying to add an 'emergency declaration' clause to the constitution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Student",
      "text": "Is the emergency declaration similar to Korea's martial law?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Teacher",
      "text": "There are similarities. For instance, if the Prime Minister claims there's a 'risk of social order disruption,' they can use special powers to run the country. They can issue orders with the same force as laws and give directions to local governments."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Student",
      "text": "That sounds convenient, but I'm worried."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Teacher",
      "text": "Yes, you're right. While it's useful to respond quickly in emergencies, it can be very dangerous if these powers are abused. For example, the Prime Minister might run the country in ways that benefit them or take away people's freedoms."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Student",
      "text": "Could the military get involved in politics like in Korea?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Teacher",
      "text": "We can't completely rule it out, which is why we need to be careful. We citizens need to closely monitor whether the LDP's constitutional amendment proposal includes appropriate restrictions to prevent abuse of power and speak up. It's important for each of us to take an active interest in preventing damage to our democracy."
