      "text": "Now, I know what you're thinking—the great Sir Christopher Lee, who played Saruman in Peter Jackson's original trilogy, passed away in 2015. So, how could he possibly return for a new project almost a decade later? Well, the answer lies in some incredible use of archival recordings. According to an article from Gizmodo titled 'War of the Rohirrim Used Christopher Lee’s Archives to Bring Him Back as Saruman,' the creative team behind the film has found a way to incorporate Lee's voice into the new project."

      "text": "The producers of 'War of the Rohirrim,' led by Philippa Boyens, decided to use archival recordings of Lee's original performance to forge new dialogue for Saruman. The team explored alternate takes of lines he delivered in 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' to piece together a new line for the upcoming anime prequel. The line they used, you might remember, was Saruman's question to Galadriel: 'Are you in need of assistance, my Lady?' during their encounter with the Necromancer at Dol Guldur. It's an iconic moment that resonates with the power and authority Saruman brought to Middle-earth."

      "text": "Boyens mentioned in the interview that they even received a letter from Christopher Lee before his passing, and also had conversations with Lee's wife, Birgit Kroencke, who gave her blessing for the use of his voice. She noted that Lee would have wanted this—to once again take part in this beloved universe he was so passionate about. And indeed, after a thorough search for a sound-alike actor yielded no satisfying results, the creative team felt there was no better way to honor Lee's legacy than to use his own performance, reimagined from those archives."

      "text": "It's really amazing to see how technology is enabling us to do this—using archival footage and recordings to bring back elements of an actor's talent, even after they're gone. It's a unique form of immortality for these larger-than-life performances. This is not the first time that technology has played a role in preserving iconic voices. The article also points out James Earl Jones, who sold his voice rights to an AI company before his passing, ensuring that his legendary voice as Darth Vader can continue to resonate in the Star Wars universe."

      "text": "But what stands out about 'War of the Rohirrim' is that this isn't some cold, algorithmically generated facsimile. Instead, the team went back to the original sessions, where Christopher Lee not only delivered lines but spoke in-between takes, sharing insights, laughing, and fully engaging with the world of Middle-earth. By carefully weaving those moments together, they were able to create something that feels true to Lee's essence and passion. Boyens said, and I quote, 'I’m so glad we used his own voice.' It's a testament to the respect the creators had for Lee's irreplaceable contribution."

      "text": "Of course, this also opens up an important conversation about the ethics of using someone's likeness or voice after they've passed away. In a time when generative AI is on the rise, studios are starting to look at technology as a way to either cut costs or replace actors entirely—and that's a whole other topic we could spend hours on. It raises questions about whether or not we're honoring the actors or potentially depriving others of opportunities."

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "But in this case, it's clear that the creative team behind 'War of the Rohirrim' approached the matter with the utmost respect for Sir Christopher Lee and his legacy. They went the extra mile to ensure his performance was as authentic as possible, rather than taking an easy technological shortcut."

      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "It's stories like these that remind us how much of an impact beloved actors can have—their performances echoing across time, their voices becoming almost synonymous with the very characters they play. Christopher Lee as Saruman is, and will always be, an iconic pairing. It's wonderful that technology, when used thoughtfully, can help bring these incredible performances back for us to enjoy."

It promises to be a fascinating addition to the rich lore of Middle-earth, especially with the involvement of so many original cast members. And it's comforting to know that Sir Christopher Lee's powerful presence will still resonate, guiding us through yet another adventure in Tolkien's universe."
